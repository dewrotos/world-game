# world-game
Open-source, open-world multiplayer game. All content is open-source. New content and systems can be proposed and created by anyone. Aiming to create the broadest and robust open-world multiplayer game available.

# Contact Me
Hello, if you've bumped into this project and would like to learn more or make any suggestions, feel free to reach out to me at dewrotos@gmail.com. I will try to keep this page updated and will eventually get to fleshing out the wiki with new plans, systems, updates, and ways for others to contribute once I get the base prototype finished. I am open to any and all suggestions so do not be afraid to reach out!

# Why I'm doing this
I've been gaming all my life and have always loved multiplayer games. As a teen in the late 2000s and early 2010s, I played a lot of Call of Duty multiplayer and eventually moved into MMOs (mainly World of Warcraft) as I began attending university. I still mainly play World of Warcraft, but have been trying to find a new game with an open-world where I can do anything I please. Sadly, there doesn't seem to be a game like this that isn't very limited in what you can do, nor do they focus on player interaction at its core.

World will fill that role. Player community focused at its core, you will be able to do anything you please (eventually!). This is where I believe the open-source aspect will drive this game's development. Personally, I want a game where there are towns of players who do different tasks to drive each other's goals. One player can focus on gathering resources to sell to other players who can use those resources to build a store to sell items they created from other resources. Eventually, players will create a town where everyone has roles that they can perform, or just hang out and chat. Having shared goals in an open-world game is central to what I think would be a perfect multiplayer game.

However, I am sure other people would prefer FPS combat like battle royales, creating things like paintings to share with friends, or searching for secrets in far corners of the world sort of like Sea of Thieves. If players have enough interest in this, they can collaborate and integrate them into the game themselves through open-source development! Of course, there will be some peer review and approval systems in place so the game will not be bloated with all kinds of weird or half-baked systems. This will be fleshed out further down the line.

# What I'm using
World will be running in Unreal Engine. I do not have the experience or interest in developing my own engine, and since this game will be open-source, I believe it should be developed in a mainstream engine. I chose Unreal over Unity because I felt that Unity had performance issues, and for a game of this scope, Unreal would be a better option. If you disagree or have better suggestions on this subject, feel free to email me and share your thoughts.

# Prototype
Right now, I am focusing on getting a small world created with systems to allow multiple players to connect and communicate as the prototype. From there, I will focus on simple player/mechanic interactions like picking up objects and managing an inventory. All of this will be developed with open-source development in mind. I believe object-oriented programming is the way to go when creating all of this, so that systems can be expanded on later in development.

# Current progress
Downloading Unreal Engine today and experimenting with it's interface and working on creating a flat plane that the player can move around in.
